/**
 * @description Returns `false`.
 * 
 * @returns { false } "false".
 * 
 * 		- Return type: The function returns a boolean value, which means it can take on
 * only two values - true or false.
 * 		- Value: The function always returns false. This means that the output of the
 * function is always the same, regardless of any input provided to the function.
 * 		- Scope: The function has no scope as it is defined inside an IIFE (Immediately
 * Invoked Function Expression) and does not access any external variables or functions.
